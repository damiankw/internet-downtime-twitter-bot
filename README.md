# internet-downtime-twitter-bot
Twitter bot that sends a tweet everytime that your internet goes down.

Configs:

- Twitter API keys (you can get them from Twitter Developer)
- Debug (default = true), logs info into the console and tweets when true
- CheckInterval (depends on debug), time in seconds for the loop that checks connection interval
- CheckTimeout (depends on debug), time in seconds to wait before returning that internet's down

- Files log names
- File encoding (default UTF8) for reading

Of course you can tweak anything. Have fun!
